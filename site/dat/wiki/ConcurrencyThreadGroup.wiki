== Description ==

This thread group offers simplified approach for configuring threads schedule. It is intended to maintain the level of concurrency, which means starting additional during the runtime threads if there's not enough of them running in parallel. Unlike standard Thread Group, it won't create all the threads upfront, so extra memory won't be used.

The preview graph reacts immediately to changes in the fields, showing you the planned concurrency schedule.
